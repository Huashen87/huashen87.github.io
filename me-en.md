# About Me

Hi, I’m Huashen. I am currently working as a Compiler Engineer at an IC design company, where I focus on the development and optimization of NPU compilers. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University, where I built a solid foundation in system software and programming languages.

Previously, I worked at a software startup for nearly two years as a backend developer, where I gained hands-on experience with various programming languages, frameworks, and database systems. During this time, I contributed to the development of blockchain applications and ERP systems, becoming proficient with software development and project management tools. I also have some frontend development experience and am familiar with modern web development processes and related technologies.

I am passionate about software development and enjoy leveraging programming to solve problems and build applications. In particular, I am highly interested in game development, with experience in both collaborative and independent projects.

My strengths include self-directed learning, requirements analysis, teamwork, and problem-solving, as well as the ability to quickly grasp key concepts and adapt to new technologies.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you’d like to connect.
